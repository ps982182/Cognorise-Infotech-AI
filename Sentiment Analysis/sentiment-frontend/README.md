- History table of analysed tweets with sentiment labels.
- Interactive pie, bar, and line charts to visualize sentiment distribution and trends.
- Responsive, user-friendly React frontend with Bootstrap styling.
- Flask backend serving the sentiment model with Hugging Face Transformers.
- Easy to deploy on free cloud platforms like Heroku (backend) and Vercel/Netlify (frontend).

## Technologies Used
